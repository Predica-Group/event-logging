* Add interface `ValidationErrorHandler` and change `ExceptionAndLoggingErrorHandler` and `LoggingErrorHandler` to implement it. Change constructors on `DefaultEventLoggingService` to take a `Supplier<ValidationErrorHandler>` instead of a `ErrorHandler`. Add `QuietErrorHandler` and make this the default. Default behaviour for no-args constructor on `DefaultEventLoggingService` is now to log a single `Logger` message containing all found validation messages at either `ERROR` or `WARN` level as appropriate. Previous behaviour was to log a stacktrace for the first validation failure in LOG mode. THROW mode previously only worked if `ExceptionAndLoggingErrorHandler` was used, now it can be used with `LoggingErrorHandler` or `QuietErrorHandler`, throwing when validation has done as much as it can.


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
